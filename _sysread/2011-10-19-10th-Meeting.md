</ul>
<blockquote>
Web browsers play host to more and more of our programs and data, but  their inner workings and the engineering challenges they face are not  widely understood.  Browsers are being used on resource-constrained  devices: how can their performance be improved?  They are under constant  attack by malicious web content: what assurances do we have that they  can resist those attacks?  And while the common browsers appear to be  converging on similar UIs, they all support extensions to varying  degrees: what kinds of extension are possible, and how might these  extensions subvert the performance and security properties we would like  to preserve?

In this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of browser architecture,  focusing on C3, an experimental browser I helped develop at Microsoft  Research.  I'll touch on each of the points above, and describe some of  the related research questions I want to address in the future.  I'd  like this talk to be a free-form discussion on whichever facets of  browser design people find most interesting.</blockquote>
