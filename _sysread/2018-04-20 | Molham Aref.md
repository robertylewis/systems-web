Title: Solver-Aided Declarative Programming

Abstract:
I will summarize our work on a declarative programming language that offers native language support for model (or instance) finding. This capability can be used to express predictive (e.g. machine learning) and prescriptive (e.g. combinatorial optimization) analytics. The presentation gives an overview of the platform and the language. In particular, it focuses on the important role of integrity constraints, which are used not only for maintaining data integrity, but also, for the formal specification of complex optimization problems and probabilistic programming.
