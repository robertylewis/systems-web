## How do we know what students know about computer science?

The assessment and evaluation of human learning is, broadly, a mess. In short, we are either very confident about a trivial bit of knowledge (e.g., memorization of inert facts) or unconfident about a valuable skill or knowledge (e.g. "this person is good at teamwork”). In this talk, I will cover the different methods and models we use in the learning sciences for assessing knowledge and show how and why our team is using data mining, visualization, and HCI to try to build creative, equitable, deep, and precise measures of computer science knowledge. In doing so, I will provide examples from games we’ve built, the assessments we’ve given, and compare the trade-offs of our approaches.
