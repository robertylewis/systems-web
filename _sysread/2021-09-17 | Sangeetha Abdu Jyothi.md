<p><b>Abstract:</b><br />
The Internet has played a key role in helping us deal with the coronavirus
pandemic, a hard-to-predict rare event that significantly altered the course of
our lives. However, Internet researchers and operators are mostly blind to
another low-probability, high-impact event that poses a direct threat to the
Internet infrastructure. In this talk, I will discuss the cosmic phenomenon of
solar superstorms, which can potentially cause large-scale Internet outages
covering the entire globe and lasting several months. I will present the
challenges posed by this natural disaster and the preliminary analysis on the
robustness of the current Internet infrastructure against this threat. Finally,
I will discuss currently available mitigation techniques and lay out steps to
improve the Internetâ€™s resiliency.
