What happens when we try to use formal methods in industries that don't 'need' it? Hillel is someone who helps 'atypical' companies - those outside the usual cliche of 'nukes and NASA' - apply formal methods to their business problems. Sometimes it doesn't even end in disaster! Hillel will share some background on his work, how FM helps businesses, and some of the lessons he's learned. Please note this isn't a formal presentation, and we're expecting more of a back and forth dialogue.

Host professor: Tim Nelson
