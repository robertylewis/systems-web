Complex Event Processing at Southwest Airlines

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an approach that derives value from correlating, aggregating, and transforming multiple event streams. At Southwest Airlines there are many business domains and use cases where such an approach can be applied. The decision to use CEP depends on the complexity of the event processing that is required as well as other factors such as architect simplicity, resource availability, and cost. Some examples of the application of CEP at Southwest Airlines will be presented.
