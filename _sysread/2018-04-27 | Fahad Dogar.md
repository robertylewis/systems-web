Title: Re-architecting Network Services for Modern Networked Applications

Abstract:
Modern networked applications often have stringent performance requirements, which stress the simple TCP/IP service model of today’s Internet. In our research, we are exploring how we can re-architect network services -- at different levels of the network stack -- to support a wide range of networked applications, including highly distributed applications that run inside the cloud, as well as wide-area Internet applications, such as video conferencing and emerging IoT and augmented reality applications. In this talk, I will mainly focus on ReWAN, a cloud-based packet recovery service for latency sensitive applications. ReWAN supplements the best effort packet delivery service of today’s Internet by judiciously using the inter data center paths *only* for packet recovery. We have evaluated ReWAN across several application and network scenarios, highlighting its benefits in providing fast packet recovery at a low cost.

Bio: Fahad Dogar is an assistant professor in the CS department at Tufts. He received his PhD from Carnegie Mellon and an undergraduate degree in CS from LUMS (Pakistan). Before joining Tufts, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, UK. He is broadly interested in networked systems, with a focus on cloud systems, future Internet architectures, and transport protocols.
