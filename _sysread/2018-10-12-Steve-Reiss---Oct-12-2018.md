The Paradox of Software Visualization Retrospective

Software visualization seems like such a logical and
helpful concept with obvious benefits and advantages. But
after decades of research and work, it has yet to be suc-
cessful in any mainstream development environment. What
is the reason for this paradox? Will software visualization
ever be actually widely used? In this paper we argue that
most past and current work in the field (our own included)
is out of touch with the reality of software development
and that new approaches and new ideas are needed.

This paper was originally presented in 2005.  We show
what has been done since has not significantly improved
on the situation and leave it as a challenge to
researchers in the field to address the underlying
problems.
