Title: Improving Quality of Experience (QoE), Usability, and Privacy of Smartphone Applications.

CIT 368, Noon

Abstract: For too long, performance has been the primary concern for smartphone applications with little attention to user-facing metrics such as QoE, privacy, and usability. There is general agreement that these user-facing metrics are critical to application adoption. The problem is that these metrics are often subjective and difficult to quantify. In this talk, I will first describe our work Webgaze that uses eye gaze tracking to improve Web QoE. We show that traditional Web performance metrics have little correlation with user experience. Yet, Web optimizations are designed to improve these traditional metrics. Instead, I show how we can build a practical system that leverages eye tracking to improve Web QoE.

<div class="">I will then provide an overview of our work on privacy and usability. Specifically, I will talk about our ongoing work PrIA which is about building a Private Intelligent Assistant locally on the phone, without leaking private information to the cloud.</div>
<div class="">I will also briefly describe UIWear, a system to easily extend smartphone apps to wearable devices with an  order-of-magnitude lower developer effort.</div>
