	<li><strong>Abstract</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Timely and cost-effective analytics over "big data" is now a key  ingredient for success in businesses and scientific disciplines. The Hadoop platform---consisting of an extensible MapReduce execution  engine, pluggable distributed storage engines, and a range of procedural  to declarative interfaces to express analysis tasks---is an emerging  choice for big data analytics. Hadoop's performance out of the box can  be poor, causing suboptimal use of resources, time, and money (e.g., in  pay-as-you-go clouds). Unfortunately, practitioners of big data analytics such as business  analysts, computational scientists, and researchers often lack the  expertise to tune the Hadoop platform for good performance.

I will introduce Starfish, a self-tuning system for big data analytics. Starfish builds on Hadoop, while adapting to system workloads and user  needs to provide good performance automatically; without any need for  users to understand and manipulate the many tuning knobs in the Hadoop  platform. While Starfish's design is guided by work on self-tuning  database systems, I will discuss how new analysis practices (dubbed the  MADDER principles) over big data pose new challenges; leading us to  different design choices in Starfish. Starfish is under active  development and is available at: <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/starfish">http://www.cs.duke.edu/starfish</a></blockquote>
