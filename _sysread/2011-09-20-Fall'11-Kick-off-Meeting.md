After a long a summer break, we are back with our regular schedule. Our next meeting will be different from the usual paper-reading model. Grad students will volunteer to give a short-presentation on their current research, allowing time for questions from the audience.

Each student has two minutes to present a brief overview of their research and will answer questions from the faculty and other students for the following eight minutes. Time will be monitored to make sure all students have time to present their work. Please, come prepared.
