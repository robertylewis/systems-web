### Abstract

The possibility to programmatically add new functionality to network data planes
has lately opened new exciting research directions. In this talk, I will present
some of the work I have been doing towards rethinking the role of programmable
switches when developing scalable network telemetry systems. I will discuss
challenges and opportunities when dealing with the design of algorithms that aim
at reducing the cost of data collection as much as possible. I will then
conclude my talk with open research questions and considerations on how, in the
future, programmable switches shall support new applications.
