Understanding the power draw of mobile devices has received
considerable attention, as energy is the limiting resource in these
platforms. In particular, background activities on mobile devices can

the user. They can range from useful but sometimes overly aggressive
tasks, such as polling for messages or updates from sensors and online
services, to outright bugs that cause resources to be held
unnecessarily.
