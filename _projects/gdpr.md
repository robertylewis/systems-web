Web services today store and process ever-increasing amounts of our personal data on remote
servers. This is true for large social networks like Facebook and Twitter, but also for smaller, special
purpose web services run by small and medium-sized organizations. The organizations that operate these
services are forced to spend significant resources to ensure that they comply with data protection laws,
such as the European Unionâ€™s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Compliance with this
comprehensive legislation is costly and difficult, at least in part because the standard systems
software that web-based applications rely on was never designed with user privacy in mind.

Our research seeks to understand this problem space -- what widely-used abstractions are convenient for
developers, and efficiently implemented, but hinder compliance? We are designing new, fundamentally
privacy-centric computer systems abstractions that seek to achieve compliance with GDPR-like legislation
by default.
