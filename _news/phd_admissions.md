The Brown Systems group is growing! In September, [Malte](https://cs.brown.edu/people/malte) joined
the group as a new Assistant Professor, and several new masters and undergraduate students have
joined our group this semester. Check out our [current projects](/projects), the
[papers](/publications) we've published, and our seminar series, [sysread](/sysread).

If you enjoy building computer systems and you're excited about research in graduate school, we'd
love to have you join the Brown Systems family. Our style is to build real systems that solve the
kind of problems that require intellectual insight and rigour, and we're a collaborative group
with projects that often involve multiple faculty, including others in the department that work on
databases, robotics, computer security, or algorithms.

Applications to the Brown CS doctoral program go through the Brown Graduate School. The CS
department website has [detailed instructions](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/applications/)
on how to apply. If you have questions, please shoot any one of us an email!

***The application deadline is December 15, 2019. Note: starting this year, no GRE scores are
needed to apply to the Brown CS PhD program.***

We look forward to your application and hope to have you join the Brown Systems family soon :-)
