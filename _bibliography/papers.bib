  abstract = {Security is particularly important in robotics, as robots can
  directly perceive and affect the physical world.  We describe the
  results of a scan of the entire IPv4 address space of the Internet
  for instances of the Robot Operating System (ROS), a widely used
  robotics software platform.  We identified a number of hosts
  supporting ROS that are exposed to the public Internet, thereby
  allowing anyone to access robotic sensors and actuators. As a proof
  of concept, and with the consent of the relevant researchers, we
  were able to read image sensor information from and actuate a
  physical robot present in a research lab in an American
  university. This paper gives an overview of our findings, including
  our methodology, the geographic distribution of publicly-accessible
  platforms, the sorts of sensor and actuator data that is available,
  and the different kinds of robots and sensors that our scan
  uncovered.  Additionally, we offer recommendations on best practices
  to mitigate these security issues in the future.}

	Title = "Toward Usable Network Traffic Policies for IoT Devices in Consumer Networks",
	Year = "2017",
	abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has brought
millions of small, low-cost, connected devices into our homes, cities,
infrastructure, and more.  However, these devices are often plagued by
security vulnerabilities that pose threats to user privacy or can
threaten the Internet architecture as a whole.  Home networks can be
particularly vulnerable to these threats as they typically have no
network administrator and often contain unpatched or otherwise
vulnerable devices.

In this paper, we argue that the unique security challenges of home
networks require a new network-layer architecture to both protect
against external threats and mitigate attacks from compromised
devices.  We present initial findings based on traffic analysis from a
small-scale IoT testbed toward identifying predictable patterns in IoT
traffic that may allow construction of a policy-based framework to
restrict malicious traffic.  Based on our observations, we discuss key
features for the design of this architecture to promote future
developments in network-layer security in smart home networks.}

	Year = "2016",
	abstract={Testing and debugging networks in situ is
                  notoriously difficult.  Many vital correctness
                  properties involve histories over multiple packets
                  (e.g., prior established connections). Checking such
                  properties requires cross-packet state, which cannot
                  be fully captured on stateless switch hardware.
                  Recent SDN work is enabling limited switch
                  operations on persistent state.  We present runtime
                  checking of cross-packet correctness properties as a
                  unique and instructive use case for developing
                  stateful switch primitives.  In this paper, we
                  examine a set of cross-packet properties and distill
                  from them switch features needed to monitor their
                  correctness.  We then contrast these against
                  features provided by current approaches to switch
                  state in SDNs and identify semantic gaps with an eye
                  toward informing future switch instruction sets.  }
